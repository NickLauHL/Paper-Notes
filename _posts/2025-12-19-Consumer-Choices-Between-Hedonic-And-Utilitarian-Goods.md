## A hedonic item is relatively preferred over the same utilitarian item in forfeiture choices than in acquisition choices. 


## Research Background

Consider consumers who may have to choose one of two options neither of which they currently own; alternatively, consider consumers who may have to forfeit one of two options, both of which they
currently own. Hedonic attributes will be weighed more heavily in relative terms when consumers are deciding which one of two options to give up as opposed to which one of two options to acquire.

## Theory Development

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Hedonic goods</span>: as ones whose consumption is primarily characterized by an affective and sensory experience of aesthetic or sensual pleasure, fantasy, and fun.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Utilitarian goods</span>: are ones whose consumption is more cognitively driven, instrumental, and goal oriented and accomplishes a functional or practical task.

**A choice (as opposed to rating) task** generally favors the option that is higher on the utilitarian dimension. 

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Forfeiture choices stimulate more spontaneous elaboration than do acquisition choices</span>: we suggest two reasons for this differential elaboration: First, it is likely that the more time consumers have to examine and interact with the object in the forfeiture condition, the more they will tend to elaborate on the object’s potential benefits. A second argument for greater elaboration in the forfeiture condition builds on the literature on counterfactual thinking. Consumers are more likely to elaborate spontaneously on alternative future outcomes when they have to forfeit an item (i.e., an upward prefactual) than when they acquire an item (i.e., a downward prefactual.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Such differential spontaneous elaboration in the forfeiture choice condition enhances the relative valuation of hedonic attributes.</span>: elaboration increases the influence of more easily imaginable attributes on product evaluations, making them more salient. To the extent that **hedonic attributes are more sensory and imagery-evoking** (MacInnis and Price 1987), the relative attractiveness of an item that is superior on the hedonic dimension should thus be enhanced. And upward prefactual thinking induces negative emotions, because one is about to be worse off than before. Respondents may be motivated to **minimize the anticipated negative emotions** by retaining the more hedonic good.


## Emperical

Goal of Experiment 3
To test whether the “forfeiture vs. acquisition” effect can be created without actual ownership, purely by changing the reference option (i.e., what the participant currently has).

Between-subject factor (2 levels): Reference item quality
	•	Superior reference item (both attributes good)
	•	Inferior reference item (both attributes poor)

Participants first read a short description of what they currently have (the reference item). This reference was manipulated:
**Condition A**: Inferior reference item → “Acquisition-like”
The participant starts from a bad situation (both attributes poor). Moving to either option means gaining an improvement on at least one attribute.
**Condition B**: Superior reference item → “Forfeiture-like”
The participant starts from a good situation (both attributes good). Moving to either option requires giving up one of the good attributes (lose utilitarian benefit or lose hedonic benefit).

Concrete example (Apartment scenario, from Appendix):
	•	Inferior reference: current apartment = “parking lot view + 45-min commute”; choose between (i) “great view but still 45-min commute” vs (ii) “10-min commute but parking lot view.”
	•	Superior reference: current apartment = “great view + 10-min commute”; choose between (i) “great view but 45-min commute” vs (ii) “10-min commute but parking lot view.”
  
比如你现在住的公寓窗外是停车场，通勤要45分钟。
你要搬家，只能选下面一个：
公寓1：窗外景观很美，但通勤仍要45分钟。
公寓2：窗外仍是停车场，但通勤只要10分钟。
问题：你选公寓1还是公寓2？

现在住的公寓窗外景观很美，通勤只要10分钟。
你要搬家，只能选下面一个：
公寓1：窗外景观仍很美，但通勤变成45分钟。
公寓2：通勤仍10分钟，但窗外变成停车场。
问题：你选公寓1还是公寓2？

Each scenario included two attributes:
	•	one utilitarian attribute
	•	one hedonic attribute

In each scenario, participants were asked to choose between two options:
	•	Option f: better utilitarian / worse hedonic
	•	Option h: better hedonic / worse utilitarian

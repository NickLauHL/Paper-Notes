## Research Background

How perceivers’ views of a target person’s antagonism relate to 
their perceptions of the target’s general competence and leadership effectiveness 
depends on perceivers’ idiosyncratic worldviews.

## Theory Clarification

**Antagonism**: behaviors and people variously seen as mean, tough, forceful,
coercive, intimidating, aggressive, and disagreeable.

## Findings

We propose that those who see the social world
as a “competitive jungle” tend to attach greater value to antagonism,
responding with heightened tolerance or even appreciation for
leaders who show it. Those who see the world as collaborative and
caring, on the other hand, may often view antagonistic leaders as
hopelessly misguided and ineffective.

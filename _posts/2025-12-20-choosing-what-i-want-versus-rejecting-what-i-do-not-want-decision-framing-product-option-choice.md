## The subtractive option-framing presents consumers with a fully loaded product and asks them to delete options they do not want. The addictive option-framing) presents them with a base model and asks them to add the options they do want. Consumers tend to choose more options with a higher total option price when they use subtractive versus additive option framing. Although subtractive option framing offers strong advantages to managers when product commitment is high, it appears to demotivate category purchase when product commitment is low. 


## Research Background



## Theory Development

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Subtractive option-framing</span>: Subjects are asked to delete undesired product options from a fully loaded model (–OF, 顶配版进行减配).  In this case, the consumer’s problem is to anticipate a loss in utility by deleting options, though this loss is compensated by a lower price paid.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Addictive option-framing</span>: Subjects are asked to add desired product options to a base model (+OF,基础款进行加配).
In this case, the consumer’s problem is to anticipate expected gains in utility, though these gains are achieved through the loss of monetary resources (i.e., a
higher purchase price).

Two factors that differentiate –OF from +OF: 
(1) **the vantage point** from which consumers start (e.g., the base model or the full model) and 
(2) **the task** they are asked to perform (e.g., adding or deleting options). 



**A choice (as opposed to rating) task** generally favors the option that is higher on the utilitarian dimension. 

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Forfeiture choices stimulate more spontaneous elaboration than do acquisition choices</span>: we suggest two reasons for this differential elaboration: First, it is likely that the more time consumers have to examine and interact with the object in the forfeiture condition, the more they will tend to elaborate on the object’s potential benefits. A second argument for greater elaboration in the forfeiture condition builds on the literature on counterfactual thinking. Consumers are more likely to elaborate spontaneously on alternative future outcomes when they have to forfeit an item (i.e., an upward prefactual) than when they acquire an item (i.e., a downward prefactual.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Such differential spontaneous elaboration in the forfeiture choice condition enhances the relative valuation of hedonic attributes.</span>: elaboration increases the influence of more easily imaginable attributes on product evaluations, making them more salient. To the extent that **hedonic attributes are more sensory and imagery-evoking** (MacInnis and Price 1987), the relative attractiveness of an item that is superior on the hedonic dimension should thus be enhanced. And upward prefactual thinking induces negative emotions, because one is about to be worse off than before. Respondents may be motivated to **minimize the anticipated negative emotions** by retaining the more hedonic good.


## Emperical

Goal of Experiment 3
To test whether the “forfeiture vs. acquisition” effect can be created without actual ownership, purely by changing the reference option (i.e., what the participant currently has).

Between-subject factor (2 levels): Reference item quality
	•	Superior reference item (both attributes good)
	•	Inferior reference item (both attributes poor)

Participants first read a short description of what they currently have (the reference item). This reference was manipulated:
**Condition A**: Inferior reference item → “Acquisition-like”
The participant starts from a bad situation (both attributes poor). Moving to either option means gaining an improvement on at least one attribute.
**Condition B**: Superior reference item → “Forfeiture-like”
The participant starts from a good situation (both attributes good). Moving to either option requires giving up one of the good attributes (lose utilitarian benefit or lose hedonic benefit).

Concrete example (Apartment scenario, from Appendix):
	•	Inferior reference: current apartment = “parking lot view + 45-min commute”; choose between (i) “great view but still 45-min commute” vs (ii) “10-min commute but parking lot view.”
	•	Superior reference: current apartment = “great view + 10-min commute”; choose between (i) “great view but 45-min commute” vs (ii) “10-min commute but parking lot view.”
  
比如你现在住的公寓窗外是停车场，通勤要45分钟。
你要搬家，只能选下面一个：
公寓1：窗外景观很美，但通勤仍要45分钟。
公寓2：窗外仍是停车场，但通勤只要10分钟。
问题：你选公寓1还是公寓2？

现在住的公寓窗外景观很美，通勤只要10分钟。
你要搬家，只能选下面一个：
公寓1：窗外景观仍很美，但通勤变成45分钟。
公寓2：通勤仍10分钟，但窗外变成停车场。
问题：你选公寓1还是公寓2？

Each scenario included two attributes:
	•	one utilitarian attribute
	•	one hedonic attribute

In each scenario, participants were asked to choose between two options:
	•	Option f: better utilitarian / worse hedonic
	•	Option h: better hedonic / worse utilitarian

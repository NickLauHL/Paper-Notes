## Reviewers are less likely to post negative reviews early (e.g., when relatively new to a rating platform in their review history) due to concerns that doing so would make them appear as lacking warmth. This concern diminishes as the number of reviews associated with their profile increases, resulting in a discernable negative trend in ratings at the REVIEWER level. 


## Research Background

Whether online ratings are a dispassionate source of information. In this regard, one source of potential bias are reviewers’ social motives. Past research has focused largely on reviewers’ desire to convey competence, however, the lack of scholarly attention directed at reviewers’ concerns with appearing warm reveals a gap in the literature.


## Theory Development

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">MUM (Minimizing Unpleasant Message)</span>: a phenomenon whereby people avoid sharing bad news involving the message recipient because they want to avoid dealing with the negative emotions it provokes.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Strategic self-presentation</span>: can be either **acquisitive**, with people actively changing their behavior to secure the approval of others, or **protective**, with people avoiding behaviors that could result in the disapproval of others. 

A key factor that motivates protective self-presentation is the multiple audience problem (Leary 1995), communicating with different audiences simultaneously. One well-known protective self-presentation strategy involves limiting what one says publicly to reduce the risk of negative evaluations from others.



## Emperical

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> Archival data analysis (https://www.yelp.com/dataset)</span>

IV: **Number of Previous Ratings**, is the number of ratings posted by a specific reviewer before the focal rating. [**a time-unstructured sequence**]

DV: **Rating**, is an ordinal variable with five levels (1-5 stars) and is the criterion variable in our estimation. 

Control:  **time-invariant** covariates at the reviewer level using a fixed effect specification; 
          **time-varying** covariates: **Days Since First**, which, for each focal rating, accounts for the number of days elapsed since the reviewer’s first review.
          
Method: Fixed-effect ordered logistic regression.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> Scenario Experiment: 2 (Valence: Positive vs. Negative) x 2 (Number of Previous Ratings: Few vs. many)</span>

Having joined a university-specific online rating community... set up their profile and created a distinct username for their profile... **recall either a positive or negative restaurant experience** that had occurred in the neighborhood surrounding the university...respondents were asked to imagine they had already posted either **two (Few) or 22 (Many) reviews** on the platform (Number)...respondents were shown an image of their profile indicating the number of prior reviews. Respondents reported both the **Likelihood that they would post a review about the recalled experience (1 = “Extremely unlikely” to 7 = “Extremely likely”)**, and the Rating they would assign to it, ranging from 1 to 5 stars.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> Scenario Experiment: one of 3 conditions: few reviews vs. many reviews vs. many reviews/different platform</span>

**In a third (Many-different platform) condition**, respondents were told they had completed 17 reviews on Yum, but had recently moved to a new city and joined a new review platform called JustEat where they had posted one review thus far. Their focal review would therefore be their 19th overall, but only their 2nd on JustEat.

Reviewers’ reluctance to post negative reviews early in their review history can be explained, at least in part, by self-presentation concerns. **This reluctance does not appear to depend on how many total reviews the reviewer has accumulated per se, but rather how many reviews the reviewer has shared with a particular audience**. This is consistent with self-presentation concerns influencing which ratings are shared. Indeed, when a reviewer who has already posted numerous reviews switches platforms, we observe a renewed initial reluctance to post a negative review. 

 <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Mediator</span>
 
Scenario1:Participants indicated the extent to which they believed having posted the review would influence whether others perceive them as warm (Warmth) and competent (Competence) **participants have done yet**:

Scenario2: and the extent to which they expected to be perceived as warm (Warmth) if they were to post the review **after participants report their likelihood**

3 potential self-presentation concerns: desire to appear warm, desire to appear competent, and reluctance to appear as a negative person. 
For **warmth**: how warm/friendly/nice they think they will appear. ： 1 = “Not at all” to 7 = “Quite a lot”,

For **competence** we will ask: how competent/skillful/capable they think they will appear. ： 1 = “Not at all” to 7 = “Quite a lot”,

For **negativity** we will ask: how negative/harsh/overtly critical they think they will appear.： 1 = “Not at all” to 7 = “Quite a lot”,

**Allow reviewers to post anonymous (unassociated with one’s profile)**

In the Control condition, participants were asked to choose between “Posting the review under their profile” and “Not posting the review” (i.e., a binary choice). In the Anonymous condition, reviewers were informed of the availability of an anonymous posting option. Participants were asked to choose between “Posting the review under their profile,” “Not posting the review,” and “Posting the review anonymously” (i.e., a trinary choice). 

Using a multinomial probit model.

**Prompting them to write something positive about the experience may attenuate this fear while not changing their actual star-rating** 

In the Control condition, participants described a negative experience in response to a single open-ended question; In the Prompt condition, what differed was that, when describing the negative dining experience, participants answered two separate open-ended questions, one describing the negative experience and the other prompting them to mention one positive aspect of the experience. 

## Key Points in Scenario Lab Experiment

**Set up their profile**

**A preview of their profile that indicated they had already posted either one (Few condition) or 18 (Many condition) review(s)**



## Findings

**[1]** reviewers’ reluctance to post negative reviews early (i.e., earlier versus later) in their review history can be explained, at least in part, by self-presentation concerns.This reluctance does not appear to depend on how many total reviews the reviewer has accumulated per se, but rather **how many reviews the reviewer has shared with a particular audience**.

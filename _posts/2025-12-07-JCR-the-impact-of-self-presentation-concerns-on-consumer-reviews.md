## Comparing the last student admitted to the high-score class (the “first class”) with the first student excluded from this class, who joins the “second class.” Results show that the last student in the first class is 10 percentage points less likely to attain a managerial position soon after graduating than a similar student in the second class. And this effect is initially similar between genders, it diminishes for men over time while persisting for women.


## Research Background




## Theory Development

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red">MUM (Minimizing Unpleasant Message)</span>: a phenomenon whereby people avoid sharing bad news involving the message recipient because they want to avoid dealing with the negative emotions it provokes.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red">Strategic self-presentation</span>: can be either **acquisitive**, with people actively changing their behavior to secure the approval of others, or **protective**, with people avoiding behaviors that could result in the disapproval of others. A key factor that motivates protective self-presentation is the multiple audience problem (Leary 1995), communicating with different audiences simultaneously.

## Findings

**[1]** The last student in the first class is about 10 percentage points (p.p.) **less** likely to become a manager two years after their expected graduation than a similar student in the second class.

**[2]** Shortly after graduation, the last-in-class effect is primarily driven by the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">adverse</span> impact of a lower relative rank in the first class (versus the higher rank in the second class), which <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">outweighs the positive effect </span> of a higher peer performance.

**[3]** Five years after the expected graduation, though, the negative ranking effect becomes smaller and insignificant, while the positive effect of peer performance persists.

**[4]** 

**[5]** We show that work experience and access to a network of high-performing peers can offset the negative effect of a lower rank. However, these factors tend to favor men more than women.

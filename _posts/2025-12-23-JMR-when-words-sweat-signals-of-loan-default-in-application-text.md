## Borrowers, consciously or not, leave traces of their intentions, circumstances, and personality traits in the text they write when applying for a loan. This textual information has a substantial and significant ability to predict whether borrowers will pay back the loan.

## Research Background

Text is indicative of people’s psychological states, traits, opinions, and situations

## Theory Clarification



## Emperical

**Shock** Utilizing the rule of class assignment: When students apply to a program in this university, they must inform whether they prefer to start in the fall semester (referred `to as the “first class”) or in the spring (the “second class”). All applicants then take the entrance exam together. After the exam, every applicant’s score is made public, and the top-scoring applicants for each program are invited to join their preferred class. Since the two classes have the same size and the first class is oversubscribed, the class preference of lower-scoring students is ignored, and they can enroll only in the second class. This constraint on students’ class choice allows us to examine students who are similar in many ways but attend different classes with different peers.

**Treatment Group** The last student enrolled in the first class (i.e., better-performing peers but the lowest rank within their class)

**Control Group** The first student who could not choose their class and enrolled in the second class.(i.e., a higher in-class rank but with peers who have not performed as
well as the first-class students)

In theory, students who are just above and just below the cutoff are very similar in almost every aspect. The only difference between them is that the student below the cutoff was forced to attend the second class. At the first-class cutoff, the constraint on class choice is considered **exogenous**,so it works as an instrumental variable.


## Findings

**[1]** The last student in the first class is about 10 percentage points (p.p.) **less** likely to become a manager two years after their expected graduation than a similar student in the second class.

**[2]** Shortly after graduation, the last-in-class effect is primarily driven by the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">adverse</span> impact of a lower relative rank in the first class (versus the higher rank in the second class), which <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">outweighs the positive effect </span> of a higher peer performance.

**[3]** Five years after the expected graduation, though, the negative ranking effect becomes smaller and insignificant, while the positive effect of peer performance persists.

**[4]** The effect decreases only for men. For low-ranking women in the first class, the last-in-class effect stays around -10 p.p. for at least six years after their expected graduation (persistent effect on women).

**[5]** We show that work experience and access to a network of high-performing peers can offset the negative effect of a lower rank. However, these factors tend to favor men more than women.
